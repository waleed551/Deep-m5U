# Deep-m5U
Abstract:
Methyluridine (m5U) is a vital modified nucleoside in RNA, particularly abundant in transfer RNA (tRNA). It plays a crucial role in gene expression and translation by ensuring genetic information accuracy and tRNA functionality during protein synthesis. Research has highlighted m5U's potential applications in diseases like breast cancer, stress response regulation, and viral infections. Identifying m5U modification sites is essential for understanding its role in these contexts. Current biochemical methods for this task are resource-intensive and complex. To address this, we introduce 'Deep-m5U,' a novel computational approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and tetranucleotide composition. Deep-m5U accurately identifies methyluridine modification sites, surpassing current methods. In testing on benchmark datasets, Deep-m5U achieved outstanding accuracies of 91.26% and 95.63%. This model holds great promise for drug discovery and academic research, providing insights into molecular processes and regulatory functions.
